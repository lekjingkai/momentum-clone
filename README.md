# Momentum Clone

## Overview

The is a React-based project I took up to learn React JS as well as further improving on my HTML, CSS and Javascript skills.

You can visit it at https://lekjingkai.github.io/momentum-clone/

This project is based on the Google Chrome browser extension called Momentum (https://momentumdash.com/). It's a custom home page that replaces new tabs and the home page with a personal productivty app that provides a personal space where you can have main goal, a todo app, store links and a weather app. The purpose of this app is to increase productivty and beat procastination with todo reminders. One touch I added is adding a mobile view for the app.

The purpose of this project is to create a clone of the Momentum app with the following features:

• Keep track of all your tasks with todo app

• A bookmark app to add and store your favourite links.

• Check the time

• Add a main focus goal

• Google search

• Check the current weather based on your location

• A quote and image on each load

# Built with:
• [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

Node.js is needed to run the Momentum Clone app.
